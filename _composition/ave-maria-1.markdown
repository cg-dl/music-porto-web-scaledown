description: |+
    The text is the standard Latin version of Hail Mary. The music, however, represents some heaviness beneath Mary's heart upon receiving annunciation. Although she received blessings, she also felt some hesitation to carry such a great mission. The greeting from Archangel Gabriel and words from St. Elizabeth strengthened her, which is why in the end, the music finds the resolution.

    This composition contains some dissonances and many vocal runs. This composition is not for Holy Mass, for concerts or recitals only.
