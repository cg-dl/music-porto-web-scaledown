    Salam Bunda Dukacita (English: Hail, Mother of Dolor) is a choral piece in which the text is loosely adapted to Bahasa from a beautiful hymn from a prayer book called Raccolta. The original text is in Latin.

    The text of this choral piece reflects the seven dolors of Mary, which is a devotion in the Catholic Church called the Chaplet of Seven Sorrows. 

    I dedicate this piece to the Church, but this piece has not received Nihil Obstat from any diocese, so currently, this piece is not to be used in Holy Mass yet. However, this piece is permissible for concerts, recitals, personal and communal prayers.
