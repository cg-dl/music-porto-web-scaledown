    Versa est in luctum cithara mea (English: My harp playing turned into grief) is a Latin text that originated from the Book of Job. It depicted a crushed soul, a screaming for help from Job to God, and how his body slowly deteriorating. This is my choral setting for the said text, which has SATB a cappella divisi voicing.

    This composition was recognized as a funeral motet in the past. However, this piece is not intended to be used for religious purposes. This piece is for concerts and recitals.

    My tips: the high Soprano I part in "Parce mihi Domine" could be sung by a soloist or a small group.
