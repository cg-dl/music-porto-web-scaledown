    This is my choral composition on Latin Text O magnum mysterium. It contains three movements:
    1. O magnum - consists of the first stanza of the text, with Renaissance-like hymn style (SSATBB) (00:00).
    2. Beata Virgo - consists of the second stanza of the text, sung by the soloist (SATB Solo) (02:12).
    3. Fuga - Alleluia - consists of the final 'Alleluia' exclamation of the text. This part is a fugal composition with a Baroque-like style (SATB) (04:06).

    This composition reflects the mystery of the Incarnation of the Lord (first movement), the joy of Mother Mary after giving birth to the Lord while remembering the words of St. Elizabeth (second movement), and the exclamation of the faithful singing Alleluia continuously (third movement).

    This composition is accessible and suitable for student, school, or university choir, especially for Christmas Concert or Christmas Recital. But this composition is not ideal to be used in Mass since it has not received Nihil Obstat from any diocese.
